CS-300 project implementing efficient course storage, search, and sorting using multiple data structures

## What problem was being solved?

In these projects, the main goal was to design and implement efficient
ways to store, search, and display course information for the ABCU
Computer Science program. The system needed to read course data from a
file, organize it using appropriate data structures, and allow users to
print the full course list in alphanumeric order or search for specific
courses. The broader problem was learning how different data structures
affect performance, memory usage, and usability in real programs.

## How did you approach the problem?

I approached the problem by first understanding the data requirements
and the operations the program needed to support. From there, I
evaluated different data structures such as vectors, hash tables, and
binary search trees. This helped me compare the tradeoffs between
runtime efficiency and memory usage.

This project reinforced why data structures are important. The choice of
structure directly impacts search speed, sorting behavior, and
scalability. By implementing multiple approaches, I was able to see how
theoretical concepts from the course apply to real code.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks?

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring the data loaded correctly
from the file and that prerequisites were handled properly. I worked
through this by testing with sample data, adding validation checks, and
stepping through the logic. Another challenge was keeping the output
formatting aligned with the rubric. I resolved this by comparing my
output to the expected results and making small adjustments until they
matched.

## How has this work expanded your approach to software design?

This work strengthened my understanding of planning before coding. I
spent more time thinking about structure selection, algorithm
efficiency, and data flow before jumping into implementation. I also
became more comfortable evaluating tradeoffs between readability and
performance.

Going forward, I will be more intentional about choosing data structures
based on the specific needs of the application rather than defaulting to
the simplest option.

## How has this work improved your programming practices?

These projects improved how I write maintainable and readable code. I
focused more on:

-   clear function structure
-   consistent formatting
-   meaningful variable names
-   separating responsibilities within the program

I also gained more appreciation for building adaptable code that can be
extended later. For example, organizing the course data cleanly makes it
easier to add new features in the future.
